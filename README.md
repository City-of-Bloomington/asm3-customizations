# Shelter Manager Customizations
Custom code written for COB's deployment of the [Animal Shelter Manager](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/asm3)

## Reports
We have written several custom reports that are installed in our deployment.  Reports that are deployed are stored in the production database.  However, we want to be able to keep track of our changes to these reports over time.

Deploying these reports is done through the web interface at Settings >> Reports.  Rather than just making changes through the web interface's report editor, you should work on the SQL and HTML for the report here in these files.  Then, copy and paste your changes into the edit screen in the web interface.

Documentation for writing custom reports is online at https://www.sheltermanager.com/repo/asm3_help/reports.html
